Fire Emblem Table Top Role Playing Game Character Creator:

This project was created throught the concept of creating a Database using Entity Framework Core and using MVC to display the data. The data comes from a video game named Fire Emblem and based off of table top rules. I used many classes, but the main classes, or entities, were the Character class, the Class class, and the Weapon class. Each class has properties which are based off of stats from the aforementioned video game. The Weapon and Class entities have their data already populated in the database whereas the user uses the Character entity to create their character.

My 3+ features inclue but are not limited to:

1. Created a List which is populated with several values. This is due to how a database works. There are muliple lists of data that is populated with varying values.

2. Read data from an external file. Technically speaking a database comes from an external file which is located in a sql server.

3. Visualize data in a graph, chart or other visual representation of data. My whole application takes data that is stored or entered and populates multiple fields through the MVC's Create, Read, Update, and Delete feature.
